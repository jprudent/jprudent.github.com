# About reading

## Do you know how to read ?
This intent of a writter is to communicate with a reader. The perfection of this process is achieved when the reader's mind is in sync with the writter's.

## There are two kind of reading
- The _informational_ reading is easy to read. It's just some new data the reader will remember.
- The _learning_ reading is harder to read. Reader is enlightened and will understand stuff he didn't understand.

The difference between information and learning is the difference between what the author _says_ and what the author _means_.

## There are two kinds of teachers
- _Live_ teacher whom you can ask questions.
- _Dead_ teacher, like a book.

An _original_, _great_ book tends to be like a _live_ teacher. Whereas _comment_, _summary_ are _dead_ teachers for sure, and not enlightening.

## Two kinds of books

### Theorical

- To be seen or understood
- "That" something is the case
- 3 families of theorical books
    - historical : particular past events
    - philosophical : general truth, relies on ordinary experience
    - scientific : observations under specific conditions

### Practical

- Something that *works*
- Immediate cash return
- How to do something that you think you should
- Often oratorical / propaganda

## On vicious circle
There is less and less people that knows how to read properly. Books are not so great nowadays.

## Learning plateaus

```
knowledge
|         _  plateau 3
|      __/   plateau 2
|  ___/      plateau 1
| /
|/__________> learning effort

```
There are plateaus in learning process.

## The recursivity of learning

- Level N+1     <-- your objective, good luck !
  - Level N
     - Level N-1
     - Level N-1

# How to read - overview
If the book is worth reading, it's worth 3 readings, in 3 different manners :

1. Structural / Analytic reading - Top down approach
   1. What the book is all about ?
   2. What the book is trying to say ?
   3. What is the structure of the book ?
   4. What is the main problem whick is solved (or not) ?
2. Interpretative / Synthetic - Bottom up approach
   1. Notice important words.
   2. Notice important sentences.
   3. Notice similarity for paragraphes that expresses arguments. 
3. Critical / Evaluative - Judgement, (dis)aggreement

While reading, there 1 one of the 3 manners, there are 2 ways each :
1. *Intrinsic* reading. The book is read alone, with no references in mind.
2. *Extrasinc* reading. The book is read in light of other books (dictionnary, commentary, secondary books, another great book, one's experience)

A book can be read 2 more ways :
1. As *poetry* (the art of writing, the fictionous beauty of it)
2. As *science* (pure knowledge communicated from the author)  
Best to read both as poetry *and* science.

## First reading : Structural / Analytic

- grasp the structure
- scrap the parts
- don't worry it makes it even more beautiful

### Rule n°1: What is this all about ?

You should know what kind of book you are reading before starting the reading.

Classify the book according to kind and subject matter.

- Think about the title
- Read the preface : where the author tells you what the book is about
- Read the table of content (TOC) conscienciously : where the author tells you what you will find in the book

### Rule n°2: What is it trying to say ?

State the unity of the whole book in a single senence or in a small paragraph.

About unity (aka simplicity).

### Rule n°3: What is the structure of the book ?

Set forth the major parts of the book, an show how these are organised into a whole, be connected to one another and to the unity of the whole.

- A book is made of many parts organised organicaly. It's not a collection of things, they are bound.
- About complexity (in its literal definition)
- Each part has a unity
- Need not follow the _apparent_ structure of the book
- Make your **own** blueprint

### Rule n°4: What is the problem ?

- Find out what's author problems were
- A problem is a question.
- There may be many problems.

## Second reading 

### Rule n°1: Important words

Spot the important words and throught them come to terms with the author.
- a term is not a word
- a term is an unambiguous word
- Process :
    1. Spot the words (grammatical step)
    2. Find their meanings (logical step) which is term
- a word can be many terms
    - eg : reading 
        1. for amusement
        2. for information
        3. for gaining insight
 - beware of synonyms
 - beware of translations : loose meaning
 - beware of old books: meanings have shifted
 - connect the word

 - eliminate ordinary words
 - a word can be special for a given author
 - a term can be a phrase
 
# Various tips more or less extrapolated from the book :

- Reader must be conscient of it's own knowledgable limitations. Pick a book that teaches you.
- Reading is learning only is the sense of gaining knowledge and not the skill. So, practice !
- Reader must make connection between a reading and personal experience or other readings.
- Reader must be active. Reading is an excrutiating activity.
- Reader must *take notes* on the book itself or on a pad.
- With enough will you can understand any books
