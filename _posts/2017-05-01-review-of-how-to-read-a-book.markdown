# About reading

## Do you know how to read ?
This intent of a writter is to communicate with a reader. The perfection of this process is achieved when the reader's mind is in sync with the writter's.

## There are two kind of reading
- The _informational_ reading is easy to read. It's just some new data the reader will remember.
- The _learning_ reading is harder to read. Reader is enlightened and will understand stuff he didn't understand.

The difference between information and learning is the difference between what the author _says_ and what the author _means_.

## There are two kinds of teachers
- _Live_ teacher whom you can ask questions.
- _Dead_ teacher, like a book.

An _original_, _great_ book tends to be like a _live_ teacher. Whereas _comment_, _summary_ are _dead_ teachers for sure, and not enlightening.

## On vicious circle
There is less and less people that knows how to read properly. Books are not so great nowadays.

## Learning plateaus

```
knowledge
|         _  plateau 3
|      __/   plateau 2
|  ___/      plateau 1
| /
|/__________> learning effort

```
There are plateaus in learning process.

## The recursivity of learning

- Level N+1     <-- your objective, good luck !
  - Level N
     - Level N-1
     - Level N-1

# How to read - overview
If the book is worth reading, it's worth 3 readings, in 3 different manners :

1. Structural / Analytic reading - Top down approach
   1. What the book is all about ?
   2. What the book is trying to say ?
   3. What is the structure of the book ?
   4. What is the main problem whick is solved (or not) ?
2. Interpretative / Synthetic - Bottom up approach
   1. Notice important words.
   2. Notice important sentences.
   3. Notice similarity for paragraphes that expresses arguments. 
3. Critical / Evaluative - Judgement, (dis)aggreement

While reading, there 1 one of the 3 manners, there are 2 ways each :
1. *Intrinsic* reading. The book is read alone, with no references in mind.
2. *Extrasinc* reading. The book is read in light of other books (dictionnary, commentary, secondary books, another great book, one's experience)

A book can be read 2 more ways :
1. As *poetry* (the art of writing, the fictionous beauty of it)
2. As *science* (pure knowledge communicated from the author)  
Best to read both as poetry *and* science.

## Type 1 reading : Structural / Analytic

### Rule nÂ°1: What is this all about ?

- Think about the title
- Read the preface
- Read the table of content (TOC) conscienciously


# Various tips more or less extrapolated from the book :

- Reader must be conscient of it's own knowledgable limitations. Pick a book that teaches you.
- Reading is learning only is the sense of gaining knowledge and not the skill. So, practice !
- Reader must make connection between a reading and personal experience or other readings.
- Reader must be active. Reading is an excrutiating activity.
- Reader must *take notes* on the book itself or on a pad.
