This is some notes about the book [How to read a book ?](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/567610.How_to_Read_a_Book?ac=1&from_search=true).

# Do you know how to read ?

This intent of a writter is to communicate with a reader. The perfection of this process is achieved when the reader's mind is in sync with the writter's.


# There are two kind of reading

- The _informational_ reading is easy to read. It's just some new data the reader will remember.
- The _learning_ reading is harder to read. Reader is enlightened and will understand stuff he didn't understand.

The difference between information and learning is the difference between what the author _says_ and what the author _means_.


# Various tips more or less extrapolated from the book :

- Reader must be conscient of it's own knowledgable limitations. Pick a book that teaches you.
- Reading is learning only is the sense of gaining knowledge and not the skill. So, practice !
- Reader must make connection between a reading and personal experience or other readings.
