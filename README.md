Stuff Iâ€™ve written. My unnamed something I occasionally write in. 

Some stuff are published on [my decaying blog](https://jprudent.github.io).

The issues has become my note taking app. I shamelessly take screenshots and rip-off content I read and watch. There is some writing of mine in the mix. 
This is public because I want to be able to read it without login. 
This is very personal but you can start [here](https://github.com/jprudent/jprudent.github.com/issues/8) if you're curious. 

Since October 2022, I don't use issues anymore. I switched to a note taking app called logseq. I can write more personal stuff in it that's why. I need to import my issues back in logseq, and find a way to export content I wish to publish.
