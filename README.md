Stuff Iâ€™ve written. My unnamed something I occasionally write in. 

Some stuff are published on [my decaying blog](https://jprudent.github.io).

Nowadays most things are living in the issues of this project.
It has become my note taking app. I shamelessly take screenshots and rip-off content I read and watch. There is some writing of mine though. 
This is public because I want to be able to read it without login. 
This is very personal but you can start [here](https://github.com/jprudent/jprudent.github.com/issues/8) if you're curious.
